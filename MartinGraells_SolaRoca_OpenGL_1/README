We believe executing the code produces the expected results. 
Moving the rotation widgets and the scaling slider rotate and scale our figures.
Our screenshots show how applying only rotation or scaling affect the figures, and also how apply both rotate and scale the figure.
Our methods setRotation and setScale start by setting the model matrices to identity, translating them and then applying the previous scale or rotation 
on them, depending on the method, and finally, rotating or scaling by the new values.
