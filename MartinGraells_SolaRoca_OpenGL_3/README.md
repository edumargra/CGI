# Animation

Welcome to the cube earth society animation. In this society, sponsored by RUG, 
we can see how Earth is actually shaped as a cube and how our two gods float around
us in the shapes of cats.

In all seriousness, our animation consists of 3 models, 1 cube, 1 sphere and 2 cats,
all of them at different sizes, speeds and rotational speeds, bouncing around the screen.
This is made by updating an engine which updates the position and orientation of our
objects and that changes the orientation and direction when colliding with set boundaries.
In addition, widgets can be used to change the rotation and the scale of the objects.

In order to do this, we created the struct mesh.h which contains all of the necessary 
information for each mesh.
